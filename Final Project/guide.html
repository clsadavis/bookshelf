                Shelfmate started out as a humble <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JvkHHX6nwIyid0zwBxPn_9YyE8_hgwDOFLFlnIA0mDE/edit?gid=2075325876#gid=2075325876" target="_blank">Google Sheet</a> 
                way back in 2019. As a self-proclaimed
                bookworm, I enjoyed reading many books across a broad range of genres and topics. The 
                only problem is that I never kept a record of which books I read, and, as many of us 
                have experienced, nowadays it can be difficult to remember what you did the day before, 
                much less what books you read over the course of the year, or, say, over many years.

                It upset me to think that all my reading enjoyment (and effort!) was vanishing into 
                the sands of time, so I began tracking my yearly reading on a spreadsheet. But pretty 
                quickly, I found that I needed more and more functionality from my Reading Log, because 
                not only did I want to track the books I had already read, I also wanted to organize 
                the books I wanted to read in the future! And since my TBR sits somehwere around 300 
                titles any given day, I also needed a way to sort and rank these untried titles, lest
                I be driven mad or, worse, to indecision when trying to decide what to read next.
